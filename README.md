# Kiss Consume
This is a basic KissComics crawler.

The crawler will:
* Gather issue links based on a given title
* Collect all issue links
* Save all pages of the issue in sequential order
* zip/rar into a .cbr or .cbz format

## Dependancies
```
selenium
beautifulsoup4
webdriver-manager
```
You should be able to install all of these with pip or conda, whatever you prefer.

## Reasoning
I was far far too lazy to actually download each and every one of these images one at a time and I don't really like the ads on the site, so yeah...
